## Intent:
To simplify the bidding and construction processes of commercial glass installation. This will also reduce cost through material usage optimization.

## Components:

- BuildObject.java
- Door.java
- Frame.java
- Glass.java
- Pocket.java
- ProjectBuilder.java


## TODO:

- GUI
- Unit converter (decimal inches <--> fractional inches)
- Cost calculation
- Write data to file
- Output material requirements from each object
  - mullion, intermediate, sill, stops, flashing, pocket filler, screws, rubber
- Combine material requirements for entire job, output to purchase list
- Optimize stock length usage based on _cut list_
- Door/door frame functionality
- Specify manufacturer
  - Read from manufacturer price catalog

## Ideas to consider:

- Graphical frame representation in GUI
- Frame shape generator
- Pockets should have ability to form sub-pockets
- Small database for long term job storage?
- Make application web-based
  - Unique logins
  - Secure storage
- Play with encryption?
